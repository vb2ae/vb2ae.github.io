## Understanding SBOM: The Backbone of Modern Software Security

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring the security of software applications has never been more critical. One essential tool in this endeavor is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). But what exactly is an SBOM, and why is it so important?

### What is an SBOM?

An SBOM is essentially a detailed inventory of all the components that make up a software application. Think of it as a list of ingredients for a recipe, but for software. This list includes information about libraries, tools, and processes used to develop, build, and deploy the software. The concept of SBOMs has been around for over a decade, but their importance has surged in recent years due to increasing cybersecurity threats and regulatory requirements.

### Why Are SBOMs Important?

1. **Enhanced Security**: SBOMs provide transparency into the software supply chain, helping identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. By knowing exactly what components are in your software, you can quickly address any security issues that arise.
   
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Governments and regulatory bodies are increasingly mandating the use of SBOMs to ensure software security. For instance, the U.S. government's National Cyber Strategy emphasizes the need for SBOMs in software sold to the public sector.

3. **Improved Risk Management**: With an SBOM, organizations can better manage risks associated with third-party components. This is crucial as modern software often incorporates open-source and proprietary code from various sources.

### Key Components of an SBOM

- **Component Name**: The name of each software component.
- **Version Information**: The specific version of each component.
- **Supplier Details**: Information about the supplier of each component.
- **Licensing Information**: Details about the licenses governing the use of each component.
- **Dependency Relationships**: How components are related or dependent on each other.

### How to add sboms to nuget package creation

First install the Microsoft sbom tool

    dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Sbom.DotNetTool

Second add the nuget package Microsoft.Sbom.Targets to the project you are creating nuget from

Finally add the following to the project file you want sbom created from

    		<GenerateSBOM>true</GenerateSBOM>
	</PropertyGroup>

The nuget packages can be created with dotnet pack
