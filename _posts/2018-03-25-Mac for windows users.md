# Mac for windows users

I recently bought a Mac to start developing iPhone apps



Here are some of the things I found that are different in Mac than a Windows PC



Copy is Command + c

Paste is Command + v

Undo is Command + z



You can use Command + Shift + 4 to take a screen shot like with the snippet tool in windows.  The images saves to the desktop



The delete key works like backspace on the mac.  Command + delete acts like the windows delete key





Make sure in Finder that the c drive is selected if you want finder to work more like windows explorer
