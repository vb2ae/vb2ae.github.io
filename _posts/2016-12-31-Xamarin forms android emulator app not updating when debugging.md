# Xamarin forms android emulator app not updating when debugging

I find that sometime when I am debugging a Xamarin Forms apps on a windows 10 machine the android apps do not show the latest updates in the emulator.  Typically when debugging on a windows 10 machine I do most of my debugging in the UWP app but when I switch to the hyper-V android emulator the app does not always show the latest changes.  To solve this I stop debugging the android version, go to the emulator and uninstall the app.  The next time you be debug you will see the latest version
