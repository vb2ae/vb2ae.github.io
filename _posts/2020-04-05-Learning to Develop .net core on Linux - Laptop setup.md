First thing I did was boot up the computer and enter the Bios by pressing F10 at startup.



In the BIOS i made 2 changes first I disabled secure boot so I could install Linux.





Second I made the USB drive a the primary boot device.

I went ahead and booted off the Fedora usb drive and installed it to the hard drive.  As part of the install I deleted the windows partitions and let fedora partition the hard drive.



Once installed I noticed that the Realtek rtl8821ce wifi did not work.  I tried the steps in this forum question and few like it but did not have any luck getting to work reliably.

In the end I bought a TP-Link usb wifi adapter (that has linux support) to connect to the internet
