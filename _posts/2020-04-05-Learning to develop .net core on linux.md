I have been wanting to learn how to develop software for Linux for a while.  Now that Microsoft is has been making .net core work cross platform.  By cross platform I mean it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.   I figured it was time to learn.



I see Windows 10 has been getting features added to it's Windows Subsystem for Linux.   Visual Studio Code is a light weight IDE which works cross platform (including Linux).  .Net 5 will also be cross platform. 



So I decided to get a cheap laptop and load Linux on it and see what I can do using .net on it. 



Which Linux Distro to choose.  I looked at 3 distros first Ubuntu, Mint Linux, and Fedora.  Ubuntu is a fast, simple, and secure distro.  Mint is a distro of Linux which has a similar UI to Windows 10.   Fedora is the open source version of Red Hat Linux. 



I chose to go with Fedora because it has a Developer center.  In the developer center there is section which covers .net core.

There is also a free ebook.  Available Transitioning to .NET Core on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

So to get started with Fedora  I downloaded the Fedora Media Writer and Fedora Workstation 31 iso

Note any usb drive you use as a Fedora boot disk will only work with Linux afterwards.  Use the Fedora Media Writer to create a boot USB you can use to install Fedora on a laptop
